# SentiCall

This project provides an interactive web application that allows users to analyze Arabic text sentiments, interact with a customer dataset chatbot, and visualize sentiment and customer feedback data using advanced machine learning models and visualization tools.

## Features

### üéØ **Sentiment Analysis**
- Upload Arabic audio files to transcribe and analyze sentiments (Positive, Neutral, Negative).
- Supports sentiment analysis using pre-trained BERT-based models (e.g., BERT and MARBERT).

### ü§ñ **Customer Dataset Chatbot**
- Interact with a chatbot powered by Google Generative AI.
- Answer customer-related queries and provide insights from customer feedback data.

### üìä **Data Visualization**
- Generate charts and graphs, including class distributions and feedback trends.
- Visualize company-specific feedback in interactive formats.

### üåç **Tableau Dashboard Integration**
- Access detailed customer feedback visualizations through an external Tableau dashboard.
